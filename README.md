# Data Structures, Algorithms & Problem Solving Patterns 🍡

## PROBLEM SOLVING

**How do you improve your problem solving techniques?**

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

> Recommended book. **How to solve it.** _by G. Polya_

## 1. Plan for solving problems

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/simplify
5. Look back and refactor

### Understand the problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

### Explore concrete examples

1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress with more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

### Break it down

-  Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

### Solve and simplify

1. If you cannot solve the problem, simplify.
2. Then solve the simpler problem.

### Look back & refactor

-  Can you check the result?
-  Can you derive the result differently?
-  Can you understand it at a glance?
-  Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
-  Can you improve the performance of your solution?
-  Can you think of other ways to refactor?
-  How have other people solved this problem?
